# Meteor Device-Detection

Meteor Device-Detection is a smart package which features client-side device type detection & template switching with optional [meteor-router](https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router/) support.

## Installation

Until Meteor Device-Detection is uploaded to the [Atmosphere](http://atmosphere.meteor.com/) repository, you can install it by copying this directory into the `packages` directory of your Meteor project.  You may have to create this directory.

``` sh
$ mkdir packages
$ cd packages
$ git clone https://github.com/Mystor/meteor-device-detection.git device-detection
```

Once Meteor Device-Detection is on Atmosphere, Meteor Device-Detection will be installable with [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/).

``` sh
$ mrt add device-detection
```

## Usage

### Detecting Devices

Meteor Device-Detection runs only on the client.

To determine the current type of device, you can call the following functions:

``` javascript
Meteor.Device.isTV();
Meteor.Device.isTablet();
Meteor.Device.isPhone();
Meteor.Device.isDesktop();
Meteor.Device.isBot();
```

If you are using Handlebars for templating, then they are also avaliable as handlebars helpers:

``` handlebars
{{#if isTV}}TV{{/if}}
{{#if isTablet}}Tablet{{/if}}
{{#if isPhone}}Phone{{/if}}
{{#if isDesktop}}Desktop{{/if}}
{{#if isBot}}Bot{{/if}}
```

### Detection Options

Meteor Device-Detection is based off of [express-device](https://github.com/rguerreiro/express-device), this means that it supports some of the same customization options.

You can set the following values in Javascript and then call `Meteor.Device.detectDevice();` to redetect the current device.

``` javascript
// These are the default values
Meteor.Device.emptyUserAgentDeviceName = 'desktop';
Meteor.Device.botUserAgentDeviceName = 'bot';
Meteor.Device.unknownUserAgentDeviceType = 'phone';

// Don't forget to re-detect the device!
Meteor.Device.detectDevice();
```

### User Preferences

If you are offering a different user experience to users who are on different devices, it is usually a good idea to offer them the option to change the experience which they are experiencing.  Device-Detection makes this easy by giving access to a few functions to set user preferences.

``` javascript
Meteor.Device.preferTV();
Meteor.Device.preferTablet();
Meteor.Device.preferPhone();
Meteor.Device.preferDesktop();
Meteor.Device.preferBot();

// Clear any preferences and re-analyze user-agent
Meteor.Device.clearPreference();
```

You can also get whether the user has a preference by calling

``` javascript
Meteor.Device.hasPreference();
```

### Templates

A common use case for device detection is to serve a different user experience to the user based on what their device type is.  This will often involve different templates to be displayed to the user.

Device-Detection provides a simple way to avoid ugly `{{#if isPhone}} ... {{/if}}` statements in your code, by using the `{{deviceRender}}` helper!  

If you call the device render helper with a parameter (the parameter being the name of the template), the helper will first search for, and then render, a template with that name, as well as a suffix (`_tv` for TV, `_tablet` for Tablet, `_phone` for Phone, `_desktop` for Desktop, and `_bot` for a Bot).  If it cannot find that template it will instead render the template name without any suffix as a fallback.

``` html
<template name="body">
  <!-- This template will render the following
	tv:      the template "page"
	tablet:  the template "page"
	phone:   the template "page_phone"
	desktop: the template "page"
	bot:     the template "page"
  -->
  {{deviceRender 'page'}}
</template>

<template name="page">
  <h1>Default Page</h1>
</template>

<template name="page_phone">
  <h1>Phone specific page</h1>
</template>
```

Naturally, you can customize the suffixes which you use:

``` javascript
Meteor.Device.setTVSuffix('_tv');
Meteor.Device.setTabletSuffix('_tablet');
Meteor.Device.setPhoneSuffix('_phone');
Meteor.Device.setDesktopSuffix('_desktop');
Meteor.Device.setBotSuffix('_bot');
```

#### Meteor-Router Integration

If you are using [meteor-router](https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router/), you can also call `{{deviceRender}}` with no parameters.  If you do this, deviceRouter will default to using `Meteor.Router.page()` as the template name.
